## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The application was designed to manage inventory efficiently, addressing the needs of small business owners who require a simple yet effective way to track inventory levels, manage item details, and receive alerts for low stock. The goal was to create a user-friendly mobile app that simplifies inventory management through intuitive interfaces and real-time updates.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Essential screens included a login screen, and main inventory dashboard. Features like add, delete, update, and view items were critical. The UI was designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, featuring large buttons, readable text, and clear navigation paths to ensure ease of use. The successful design was evidenced by successful testing.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached coding with a focus on modular design and clean code practices. I used object-oriented programming to encapsulate functionality, which made the code more manageable and reusable. Techniques like continuous integration and testing ensured that each part of the application worked correctly before moving on. These strategies can be applied to future projects to enhance code quality and maintainability.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I employed Android emulator testing. Using the Android Emulator, I simulated different user interactions to catch any usability issues. This process is crucial as it ensures the reliability and user-friendliness of the app, revealing areas for improvement in user flow and interaction design.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One significant innovation was in the handling of SMS permissions and notifications. I developed a fallback mechanism that allows the app to function seamlessly even when SMS permissions are denied, ensuring that the core functionality remains unaffected. This required creative problem-solving and understanding of Android's permission system.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was particularly successful in implementing the database management system. My ability to design and manipulate the SQLite database to perform efficient CRUD operations demonstrated my technical proficiency and understanding of data management within Android environments.
